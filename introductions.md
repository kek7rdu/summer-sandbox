## Introductions to one another and to GitHub

This is just a markdown file -- you can learn more about markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Once you have your github account set up (and git installed on your computer), clone this repository to your computer, answer the questions in a markdown file, add/commit the changes, and push it back up.

1. Do you play any musical instruments? If so, tell us more! If not, what instrument(s) do you love to hear or would choose to learn if you had infinite time?

* MC: Yes, I've been learning mandolin for the last 12 years! And I just got a banjo!
* JGG: I started playing drums when I was around 10 years old, and for about a decade, that was how I spent as much of my time as I possibly could. In 2011, I took up steelpan and played semi-religiously for about 5 or so years, gigging around the Florida Panhandle at wedding receptions, business openings, etc. (Before I moved to Virginia, my only experience here was visiting to play in the [Virginia International Panfest](https://www.vapanfest.org/) a couple of times. Those were the days.) Recently, I’ve been playing shamefully little music; I have no excuse other than that steel pans are [expensive](http://www.mannetteinstruments.com/classical-series.html)!
* LL: I started taking piano lessons a little while ago. I am definitely still a beginner, but it has given me something fun to do during the pandemic and I am very grateful for that!
* ML: I've been playing the flute for about 12 years, and in the last few years, I've been teaching myself guitar and ukulele.

2. Do you have any animals in your life? If you haven't had the pleasure of an animal companion, what animal(s) do you hope to one day know?

* JGG: Not currently (unfortunately). I lived with dogs for most of my life but not since moving to Charlottesville (the land of small “garden-level” apartments and no-pets lease clauses). A dog is hopefully inbound in the not-too-far-off future.
* MC: So many animals! Currently 3 dogs, 2 cats, and 3 chickens. Plus, we recently dug a frog pond in our yard and have verified a few new tenants.
* LL: I have an adorable and wise cat named Flop. My family adopted her when I was in middle school, so she's an old friend. I am always happy to share any of the __thousands__ of photos I have of her!
* ML: My family got two kittens at the beginning of the pandemic, and they are adorable! Their names are Bunsen and Beaker, and they are currently obsessed with "hunting" cicadas (aka meowing at them and getting paw prints all over the window).

3. What other questions would you suggest we ask?

* JGG: What kinds of workflows do you like or dislike? (Do you prefer doing most things via Slack/email, or are you big on face-to-face [Zoom-to-Zoom?] meetings? Do you prefer when team members work together semi-continuously, or is a once-a-week catch-up best for you?)
* LL: What are you already most comfortable/proficient doing in R (or whatever language you use), and what are you most eager to gain more practice doing? 
* ML: Is there anything that you hope others on this team can help you with?
