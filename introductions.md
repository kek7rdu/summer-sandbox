## Introductions to one another and to GitHub

This is just a markdown file -- you can learn more about markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Once you have your github account set up (and git installed on your computer), clone this repository to your computer, answer the questions in a markdown file, add/commit the changes, and push it back up.

1. Do you play any musical instruments? If so, tell us more! If not, what instrument(s) do you love to hear or would choose to learn if you had infinite time?

* MC: Yes, I've been learning mandolin for the last 12 years! And I just got a banjo!
* JGG: I started playing drums when I was around 10 years old, and for about a decade, that was how I spent as much of my time as I possibly could. In 2011, I took up steelpan and played semi-religiously for about 5 or so years, gigging around the Florida Panhandle at wedding receptions, business openings, etc. (Before I moved to Virginia, my only experience here was visiting to play in the [Virginia International Panfest](https://www.vapanfest.org/) a couple of times. Those were the days.) Recently, I’ve been playing shamefully little music; I have no excuse other than that steel pans are [expensive](http://www.mannetteinstruments.com/classical-series.html)!

2. Do you have any animals in your life? If you haven't had the pleasure of an animal companion, what animal(s) do you hope to one day know?

* JGG: Not currently (unfortunately). I lived with dogs for most of my life but not since moving to Charlottesville (the land of small “garden-level” apartments and no-pets lease clauses). A dog is hopefully inbound in the not-too-far-off future.

3. What other questions would you suggest we ask?

* JGG: What kinds of workflows do you like or dislike? (Do you prefer doing most things via Slack/email, or are you big on face-to-face [Zoom-to-Zoom?] meetings? Do you prefer when team members work together semi-continuously, or is a once-a-week catch-up best for you?)
